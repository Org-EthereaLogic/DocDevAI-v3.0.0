## Security Overview

DocDevAI v3.0.0 is designed with security and privacy as fundamental principles. Our security philosophy follows three core tenets:

1. **Privacy-First**: All data remains local, with no telemetry or cloud features enabled by default
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls protect sensitive information
3. **Transparency**: Open source security measures allow community verification

### Security Architecture

The project implements security across all 13 modules (M001-M013) with particular emphasis on:

- **M002 Local Storage**: SQLCipher encryption for all database operations
- **M007 Review Engine**: PII detection and data sanitization
- **M010 Security Module**: Advanced security features and threat detection

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure from security researchers and users.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities via one of these methods:

1. **Email**: security@devdocai.org (preferred)
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: [Create a private security advisory](https://github.com/Org-EthereaLogic/DocDevAI-v3.0.0/security/advisories/new)

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide:

- **Description**: Clear explanation of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential security impact and affected components
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed reproduction steps
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or commands demonstrating the issue (if applicable)
- **Affected Versions**: Version numbers where the vulnerability exists
- **Suggested Fix**: Recommendations for remediation (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Impact Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Updates**: Weekly during investigation
- **Fix Timeline**: Based on severity (see Vulnerability Response Process)

### Responsible Disclosure

We request that you:

- Allow us reasonable time to address the vulnerability before public disclosure
- Avoid accessing or modifying other users' data during testing
- Delete any data obtained during security research
- Do not perform actions that could harm the service or its users

## Security Features

DocDevAI implements comprehensive security measures across all modules:

### Encryption

#### Data at Rest

- **Database Encryption**: SQLCipher with AES-256 in CBC mode
- **Configuration Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for sensitive configuration data
- **API Key Storage**: Encrypted using AES-256-GCM with unique salts
- **Document Encryption**: Optional AES-256-GCM encryption for generated documents

#### Key Management

- **Key Derivation**: Argon2id with recommended parameters:
  - Memory: 64 MB
  - Iterations: 3
  - Parallelism: 4
  - Salt: 32 bytes (cryptographically random)
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic key rotation every 90 days
- **Key Storage**: Keys never stored in plaintext, derived from master password

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Local Authentication**: PBKDF2-SHA256 with 100,000 iterations
- **Session Management**: Secure session tokens with automatic expiration
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for multi-user environments
- **API Authentication**: HMAC-SHA256 signed requests for external integrations

### Input Validation

All modules implement strict input validation:

- **Schema Validation**: Zod schemas for all configuration inputs
- **Sanitization**: DOMPurify for HTML content, custom sanitizers for other formats
- **Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries, prepared statements
- **Size Limits**: Maximum file sizes and request limits enforced
- **Type Checking**: Runtime type validation for all external inputs

### Privacy Protection

#### PII Detection (M007)

- **Pattern Matching**: Regex-based detection for common PII patterns
- **ML-Based Detection**: Optional ML model for advanced PII identification
- **Redaction**: Automatic PII redaction in generated documents
- **Audit Logging**: PII detection events logged for compliance

#### Data Minimization

- **No Telemetry**: Zero telemetry collection by default
- **Local Processing**: All processing performed locally
- **Ephemeral Data**: Temporary data automatically purged
- **Opt-in Features**: Cloud features require explicit user consent

### Security Monitoring

- **Audit Logging**: Security-relevant events logged locally
- **Anomaly Detection**: Behavioral analysis for unusual patterns
- **File Integrity**: SHA-256 checksums for critical files
- **Update Verification**: Cryptographic signatures for updates

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Master Password**
   - Use a strong, unique master password (minimum 16 characters)
   - Enable password manager integration if available
   - Never share or store your master password in plaintext

2. **Configuration Security**
   - Review `.devdocai.yml` for unexpected changes
   - Keep configuration files in secure locations
   - Use environment variables for sensitive values

3. **API Keys**
   - Store API keys only in encrypted configuration
   - Rotate API keys regularly (recommended: monthly)
   - Use separate keys for development and production

4. **Updates**
   - Install security updates promptly
   - Verify update signatures before installation
   - Review changelog for security fixes

5. **Backups**
   - Encrypt backup files using provided tools
   - Store backups in secure locations
   - Test backup restoration regularly

### for Contributors

1. **Code Security**
   - Follow secure coding guidelines (OWASP)
   - Use static analysis tools before committing
   - Never commit sensitive data (use `.gitignore`)

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Review dependencies for known vulnerabilities
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use lock files for reproducible builds

3. **Testing**
   - Write security tests for new features
   - Run security test suite before PRs
   - Test edge cases and error conditions

4. **Documentation**
   - Document security implications of changes
   - Update security documentation when needed
   - Include security considerations in design docs

## Security Requirements for Development

### Mandatory Security Controls

All code contributions must implement:

1. **Input Validation**

   ```typescript
   // Example: Zod schema validation
   const configSchema = z.object({
     apiKey: z.string().min(32).max(256),
     timeout: z.number().int().positive().max(30000)
   });
   ```

2. **Error Handling**
   - Never expose internal errors to users
   - Log security errors with appropriate detail
   - Implement rate limiting for error responses

3. **Cryptographic Standards**
   - Use only approved algorithms (AES-256, SHA-256, Argon2id)
   - Never implement custom cryptography
   - Use established libraries (crypto, argon2, etc.)

4. **Secure Defaults**
   - Privacy-preserving settings by default
   - Minimal permissions principle
   - Encrypted storage for sensitive data

## Data Protection and Privacy

### Privacy Commitments

DocDevAI commits to:

1. **Data Sovereignty**: Your data never leaves your machine without explicit consent
2. **No Tracking**: Zero analytics, telemetry, or usage tracking by default
3. **Transparency**: All data processing logic is open source and auditable
4. **User Control**: Full control over all data and settings

### Data Classification

| Classification | Description | Protection Required |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
