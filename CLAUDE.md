```

### Quality Gates

- **M001, M002**: 95% test coverage requirement
- **All modules**: 80% minimum coverage
- **Code complexity**: <10 cyclomatic complexity
- **File size**: Maximum 350 lines per file
- **Performance**: Specific benchmarks per module (see docs)

## Critical Implementation Notes

### M001 Configuration Manager Specifics

- Must implement memory mode detection (baseline/standard/enhanced/performance)
- Privacy-first: telemetry disabled by default, cloud features opt-in
- Use Argon2id for key derivation, AES-256-GCM for encryption
- Configuration loading from `.devdocai.yml` with schema validation

### Testing Strategy

- Follow TDD: Write tests first, then implementation
- Use Jest for TypeScript, pytest for Python
- Performance benchmarks required for M001 (scripts/benchmark-m001.ts)
- Coverage thresholds enforced in jest.config.js

### Security Requirements

- All API keys must be encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- SQLCipher for database encryption (M002)
- Input validation required on all external inputs
- No telemetry or cloud features enabled by default

## GitHub Actions Workflows

The project uses standard GitHub Actions (no custom actions):

- **ci.yml**: Main pipeline - runs on push/PR to main
  - Multi-version testing (Python 3.9-3.11, Node 18-20)
  - CodeQL security analysis
  - Codecov integration

- **quick-check.yml**: Fast feedback on all pushes
- **release.yml**: Automated releases on version tags

## Codacy Integration

When editing files, you MUST:

1. Run `codacy_cli_analyze` after any file edit
2. Use provider: `gh`, organization: `Org-EthereaLogic`, repository: `DocDevAI-v3.0.0`
3. Run security checks with trivy after adding dependencies

## Current Development Focus: M004 AI Transformation

### Background
During testing, discovered that M004 uses simple template substitution instead of the intended AI-powered generation. Now transforming to implement the original vision.

### Original Vision vs Current State
- **Original**: Templates as LLM prompts → Multi-LLM synthesis → MIAIR optimization → AI-generated documents
- **Current**: Templates with variables → Simple substitution → Static output

### Transformation Components Created
1. **Document Workflow Engine** (`document_workflow.py`): Implements document dependency graph and multi-phase review system
2. **Prompt Template Engine** (`prompt_template_engine.py`): Processes YAML-based LLM prompt templates
3. **Review System**: Specialized LLM assignments per review phase (Requirements, Design, Security, Performance, etc.)

### 4-Pass Implementation Progress
- **Pass 1**: ✅ Core Implementation COMPLETE (Dec 19, 2024)
  - Wired all components together
  - Converted 5 core templates to YAML
  - Basic AI generation working
  - Multi-LLM synthesis operational
  - 4 core documents generating successfully
- **Pass 2**: 🔄 Performance - Next (Parallel LLM calls, caching, token optimization)
- **Pass 3**: ⏳ Security - Pending (Prompt injection protection, PII detection, rate limiting)
- **Pass 4**: ⏳ Refactoring - Pending (Consolidate implementations, reduce complexity)

## Development Philosophy

- **Privacy-First**: All data local, no telemetry by default
- **Offline-First**: Full functionality without internet
- **Test-Driven**: Tests before implementation
- **Modular**: Each module independent and self-contained
- **Performance**: Meet specific benchmarks (M001: 19M ops/sec)
- **AI-Powered**: True LLM synthesis, not just template substitution

🎉 **PROJECT 100% COMPLETE** - All 13 modules finished with production-ready quality!

## Development Method

Following a validated four-pass development approach:

1. **Implementation Pass**: Core functionality with basic tests (80-85% coverage)
2. **Performance Pass**: Optimization to meet benchmarks
3. **Security Pass**: Hardening and reaching 95% coverage target
4. **Refactoring Pass**: Code consolidation, duplication removal, architecture improvements (NEW)

Git tags are created at each pass for rollback capability (e.g., `m001-implementation-v1`, `m001-performance-v1`, `security-pass-m001`, `refactoring-complete`).
