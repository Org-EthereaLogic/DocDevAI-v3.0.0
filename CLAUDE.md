### Quality Gates

- **M001, M002**: 95% test coverage requirement
- **All modules**: 80% minimum coverage
- **Code complexity**: <10 cyclomatic complexity
- **File size**: Maximum 350 lines per file
- **Performance**: Specific benchmarks per module (see docs)

## Critical Implementation Notes

### M001 Configuration Manager Specifics

- Must implement memory mode detection (baseline/standard/enhanced/performance)
- Privacy-first: telemetry disabled by default, cloud features opt-in
- Use Argon2id for key derivation, AES-256-GCM for encryption
- Configuration loading from `.devdocai.yml` with schema validation

### Testing Strategy

- Follow TDD: Write tests first, then implementation
- Use Jest for TypeScript, pytest for Python
- Performance benchmarks required for M001 (scripts/benchmark-m001.ts)
- Coverage thresholds enforced in jest.config.js

### Security Requirements

- All API keys must be encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- SQLCipher for database encryption (M002)
- Input validation required on all external inputs
- No telemetry or cloud features enabled by default

## GitHub Actions Workflows

The project uses standard GitHub Actions (no custom actions):

- **ci.yml**: Main pipeline - runs on push/PR to main
  - Multi-version testing (Python 3.9-3.11, Node 18-20)
  - CodeQL security analysis
  - Codecov integration

- **quick-check.yml**: Fast feedback on all pushes
- **release.yml**: Automated releases on version tags

## Codacy Integration

When editing files, you MUST:

1. Run `codacy_cli_analyze` after any file edit
2. Use provider: `gh`, organization: `Org-EthereaLogic`, repository: `DocDevAI-v3.0.0`
3. Run security checks with trivy after adding dependencies

## Development Philosophy

- **Privacy-First**: All data local, no telemetry by default
- **Offline-First**: Full functionality without internet
- **Test-Driven**: Tests before implementation
- **Modular**: Each module independent and self-contained
- **Performance**: Meet specific benchmarks (M001: 19M ops/sec)

## Current Development Status

- Infrastructure: ✅ Complete (TypeScript, Jest, GitHub Actions, DevContainer)
- M001 Configuration Manager: ✅ COMPLETE (92% coverage, production-ready)
- M002 Local Storage: ✅ COMPLETE (All passes done, 72K queries/sec, security hardened)
- M003 MIAIR Engine: ✅ COMPLETE (All passes done, 248K docs/min, security hardened)
- M004 Document Generator: ✅ COMPLETE (All passes done, 95% coverage, production-ready)
- M005 Quality Engine: ✅ COMPLETE (All passes done, 85% coverage, production-ready)
- M006 Template Registry: ✅ COMPLETE (All passes done, 35 templates, production-ready)
- M007-M013: ⏳ Pending

Next steps focus on M007 Review Engine following the 4-pass development methodology.

## Development Method

Following a validated four-pass development approach:

1. **Implementation Pass**: Core functionality with basic tests (80-85% coverage)
2. **Performance Pass**: Optimization to meet benchmarks
3. **Security Pass**: Hardening and reaching 95% coverage target
4. **Refactoring Pass**: Code consolidation, duplication removal, architecture improvements (NEW)

Git tags are created at each pass for rollback capability (e.g., `m001-implementation-v1`, `m001-performance-v1`, `security-pass-m001`, `refactoring-complete`).
