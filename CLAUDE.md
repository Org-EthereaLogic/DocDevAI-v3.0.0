# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Context

DevDocAI v3.0.0 is a **Python-based** AI-powered documentation generation and analysis system for solo developers. This project follows a **design-first approach** with strict adherence to design document specifications.

**CRITICAL**: This project has been **RESTARTED FROM CLEAN SLATE** (September 7, 2025). All implementation must be built from scratch following the exact specifications in the design documents located in `docs/`.

## Current Project Status

**🎯 PRODUCTION-READY AI EXCELLENCE - M001 + M008 + M002 + M004 ALL 4 PASSES COMPLETE**

- **Implementation Status**: **M001 + M008 + M002 + M004 ALL PASSES Complete (~37% total)** - Production-ready AI-powered generation
- **Repository Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION EXCELLENCE OPERATIONAL** - Enterprise-grade with 42.2% code reduction, clean architecture
- **Design Status**: **Complete** - 52 comprehensive design documents with M004 proving Enhanced 4-Pass TDD methodology
- **Technology Stack**: **Python 3.8+ PRODUCTION-VALIDATED** - Factory/Strategy patterns, OWASP compliance, refactored architecture
- **Architecture**: **Production-Ready AI Core** - M001+M008+M002+M004 delivering enterprise-grade document generation with clean code
- **Development Method**: **Enhanced 4-Pass TDD METHODOLOGY PROVEN** - M004 complete 4-pass cycle demonstrates methodology excellence
- **Next Step**: **M003 MIAIR Engine Implementation** - Shannon entropy optimization and mathematical quality improvement

## Why the Restart?

**Architectural Drift Discovered**: Previous implementation had fundamental issues:

- ❌ M004 Document Generator used template substitution instead of AI-powered generation
- ❌ Missing M008 LLM Adapter (critical dependency for AI functionality)
- ❌ Wrong technology stack (TypeScript instead of Python as specified in design docs)
- ❌ Only 23% compliance with design document specifications
- ✅ **Solution**: Complete restart following design documents exactly

## Single Source of Truth: Design Documents

### Mandatory Reading Order

1. **[Comprehensive Project Findings](docs/04-reference/COMPREHENSIVE_PROJECT_FINDINGS.md)** - Python architecture overview
2. **[Product Requirements Document (PRD)](docs/01-specifications/requirements/DESIGN-devdocai-prd.md)** - What we're building
3. **[Software Requirements Specification (SRS)](docs/01-specifications/requirements/DESIGN-devdocai-srs.md)** - Detailed requirements
4. **[Software Design Document (SDD)](docs/01-specifications/architecture/DESIGN-devdocsai-sdd.md)** - How we're building it
5. **[Architecture Document](docs/01-specifications/architecture/DESIGN-devdocsai-architecture.md)** - System architecture
6. **[User Stories](docs/01-specifications/requirements/DESIGN-devdocsai-user-stories.md)** - User requirements

### Design Compliance Rules

**🚫 NEVER DO:**

- Implement features not specified in design documents
- Change architecture without design document update
- Skip any steps outlined in build instructions
- Add dependencies not specified in design docs
- Create files not outlined in project structure
- Deviate from specified naming conventions
- Use TypeScript/Node.js (design specifies Python 3.8+ only)

**✅ ALWAYS DO:**

- Reference specific design document sections when implementing
- Follow the exact Python architecture from `docs/04-reference/`
- Implement test-driven development as specified
- Meet all quality gates (coverage, performance, security)
- Use only Python 3.8+ and specified frameworks
- Follow the modular architecture exactly as designed

## Quality Gates (Per Design Docs)

- **All modules**: 85-95% test coverage requirement
- **Code complexity**: <10 cyclomatic complexity
- **Performance**: Specific benchmarks per module (M003: 248K docs/min)
- **Technology**: Python 3.8+ only (no TypeScript/Node.js)
- **Security**: AES-256-GCM encryption, privacy-first defaults

## Development Method

**Enhanced 4-Pass TDD Development Methodology:**

1. **Pass 1**: Core Implementation (TDD with 80% coverage)
2. **Pass 2**: Performance Optimization (meet benchmarks)
3. **Pass 3**: Security Hardening (95% coverage, OWASP where applicable)
4. **Pass 4**: Refactoring & Integration (40-50% code reduction target)

Git tags at each pass for rollback capability (e.g., `m001-pass1-v1`)

## Critical Implementation Notes

### M001 Configuration Manager Specifics

- Must implement in Python (previous TypeScript attempts were wrong)
- Privacy-first: telemetry disabled by default
- Use Python `cryptography` library for encryption
- Configuration loading from `.devdocai.yml` with pydantic validation

### M008 LLM Adapter Requirements (Critical)

- **ESSENTIAL for M004**: M004 cannot work without M008 LLM integration
- Multi-provider support with cost management
- Response caching and smart routing
- Local fallback when APIs unavailable or budget exhausted

### M004 Document Generator Requirements

- **AI-POWERED**: Uses M008 to call LLMs for content generation
- **NOT template substitution**: Templates guide AI prompts only
- Fails gracefully with error messages when LLMs unavailable
- This was the core architectural issue in previous implementation

## Repository Status

**Current State**: AI-powered document generation OPERATIONAL

- ✅ Design documentation complete (52 files)
- ✅ M001 Configuration Manager COMPLETE (enhanced performance: 1.68M+ ops/sec)
- ✅ M008 LLM Adapter COMPLETE (all 4 passes, real API validation)
- ✅ M002 Local Storage System COMPLETE (production performance: 1.99M+ queries/sec)
- ✅ M004 Document Generator ALL 4 PASSES COMPLETE (production-ready with 42.2% code reduction)
- ✅ Real API integration tested (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini working)
- ✅ Production-ready AI-powered generation (4,000 docs/min, OWASP compliance, clean architecture)
- ✅ Enhanced 4-Pass TDD methodology PROVEN (M004 complete cycle validates methodology excellence)
- 🔄 M003 MIAIR Engine: Shannon entropy optimization and mathematical quality improvement

**Git History**: Previous implementation work preserved in commits for reference, but completely removed from working directory.

## Development Philosophy

- **Privacy-First**: All data local, no telemetry by default
- **Offline-First**: Full functionality without internet
- **Test-Driven**: Tests before implementation (pytest)
- **Modular**: Each module independent and self-contained
- **Performance**: Meet specific benchmarks per design docs
- **AI-Powered**: Python-based ML/AI processing via MIAIR Engine and LLM Adapter
- **Design-First**: Strict adherence to documented architecture

# Important Instructions

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
ALWAYS follow the Python architecture specified in the design documents.
NEVER use TypeScript/Node.js - this project is Python-based as per design specifications.
CRITICAL: All implementation must use AI-powered generation via M008 LLM Adapter, not template substitution.
