## Key Documents

### For Developers
- [Software Configuration Management Plan](planning/DESIGN-devdocsai-scmp.md) - Development workflow
- [Design Decisions](decisions/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md) - Technical choices explained
- [Roadmap](planning/ROADMAP.md) - What's coming when

### For Project Management
- Progress tracking (in progress/)
- Sprint planning documents
- Milestone reviews

## Tracking Guidelines

### Progress Updates
- **Daily**: Update current sprint tasks
- **Weekly**: Module progress assessment
- **Sprint End**: Comprehensive status update
- **Monthly**: Milestone review and adjustment

### Decision Documentation
When making implementation decisions:
1. Document the decision context
2. List alternatives considered
3. Explain the chosen approach
4. Note any trade-offs
5. Update DESIGN_DECISIONS.md

### Review Process
All code must pass:
1. **Automated Tests**: 85% coverage minimum
2. **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier compliance
3. **Type Check**: TypeScript strict mode
4. **Code Review**: Peer review required
5. **Documentation**: Updated as needed

## Module Dependencies

Implementation must follow dependency order:
```
M001 (Configuration) â†’ M002 (Storage) â†’ M004 (Generator)
                    â†˜              â†—
                      M005 (Tracking)
                            â†“
                      M006 (Suite Manager)
                            â†“
                      M007 (Review Engine)
```

See full dependency graph in specifications.

## Quality Gates

Each module must meet before marking complete:
- âœ… Unit tests written and passing (85% coverage)
- âœ… Integration tests with dependencies
- âœ… Documentation complete
- âœ… Code review approved
- âœ… Performance benchmarks met
- âœ… Security scan passed

## Risk Management

### Current Risks
- **Technical Debt**: Minimize by following design specs strictly
- **Scope Creep**: Defer enhancements to post-MVP
- **Integration Issues**: Test early and often
- **Performance**: Profile from the start

### Mitigation Strategies
- Strict adherence to specifications
- Regular architecture reviews
- Continuous integration testing
- Performance profiling in CI/CD
