## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Input Validation
```python
# Comprehensive validation with whitelist approach
- ID length: 3-256 characters
- Allowed characters: [a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]
- Blocked patterns: XSS, SQL injection, path traversal, SSRF
- Content sanitization: HTML escaping, script removal
```

### 2. Rate Limiting
```python
# Configurable rate limiting per operation
- Default: 100 requests per 60 seconds
- Per-key tracking for multi-tenant scenarios
- Automatic window reset and cleanup
- Thread-safe with locking
```

### 3. Resource Protection
```python
# Prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- Max suite size: 1000 documents
- Max document size: 10MB
- Max cross-references: 10,000
- CPU/memory monitoring with alerts
```

### 4. Data Integrity
```python
# HMAC-SHA256 for tamper detection
- 256-bit keys generated with secrets module
- HMAC validation for consistency reports
- Constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
```

### 5. Audit Logging
```python
# Comprehensive security logging
- Decorator-based automatic logging
- Log sanitization to prevent injection
- Memory-bounded storage (10K entries)
- Structured format with timestamps
```

## Performance Impact

Security features added with minimal performance overhead:

| Operation | Pass 2 Time | Pass 3 Time | Overhead |
