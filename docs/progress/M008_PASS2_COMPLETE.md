```python
from devdocai.llm_adapter.adapter_optimized import OptimizedLLMAdapter

# All optimizations enabled by default
async with OptimizedLLMAdapter(config) as adapter:
    # Automatic warm-up on entry
    response = await adapter.generate(
        "Your prompt",
        use_cache=True,
        use_batching=True
    )
```
