## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Summary

### Top Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| SQLCipher integration complexity | High | Early prototype, fallback to manual encryption | üü° Monitor |
| 95% coverage target | Low | Focus on critical paths, accept 90% if needed | üü¢ Low |
| Performance with encryption | Medium | Aggressive caching, benchmark continuously | üü° Monitor |
| M001 integration issues | Low | Use stable interfaces, early testing | üü¢ Low |

### Contingency Plans
- **If SQLCipher fails**: Implement manual encryption layer with native SQLite
- **If performance degrades**: Disable encryption for non-sensitive data
- **If schedule slips**: Defer advanced features (migration, backup) to next phase

## üîÑ Integration with M001

### Configuration Integration
```typescript
// M001 provides storage configuration
const config = ConfigurationManager.getInstance().getConfiguration();
const storageConfig = config.storage;

// M002 uses configuration for initialization
const storage = StorageManager.getInstance();
await storage.initialize(storageConfig);
```

### Shared Components
- SecurityUtils for encryption operations
- Validation patterns for input sanitization
- Feature flags for encryption and storage modes

## üìù Key Design Decisions

### Why SQLite with SQLCipher?
- **Zero Configuration**: No server required
- **Performance**: Sub-millisecond queries for local operations
- **Security**: Transparent encryption at database level
- **Portability**: Single file database
- **Reliability**: ACID compliance, proven stability

### Why 95% Test Coverage?
- **Critical Module**: Data loss would be catastrophic
- **Security Sensitive**: Encryption and access control must be bulletproof
- **Foundation Dependency**: Other modules depend on M002
- **Maintenance**: High coverage reduces future bugs

### Why Singleton Pattern?
- **Resource Management**: Single database connection pool
- **Cache Consistency**: Centralized cache management
- **Configuration**: Single source of truth from M001
- **Thread Safety**: Controlled concurrent access
