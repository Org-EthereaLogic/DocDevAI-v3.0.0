   - US-018: Universal Accessibility
   - US-019: SBOM Generation
   - US-020: PII Detection
   - US-021: Data Subject Rights

3. **New Requirements Added**:

   - FR-027: SBOM Generation
   - FR-028: PII Detection
   - FR-029: DSR Implementation
   - SEC-005: RBAC (Role-based access control) as recommended by ChatGPT-5
   - SEC-006/SEC-007: Additional security requirements for signatures and erasure

4. **Module Updates**:

   - Added explicit mapping for M009 (Enhancement Pipeline)
   - Added M010-M013 for new v3.5.0 features
   - Included implementation phases for all modules

5. **Consolidation and Clarification**:

</summary_of_changes>

<inconsistencies_and_resolutions>

## Inconsistencies Found and Resolutions

1. **Version Mismatch**:
   - **Issue**: Traceability Matrix was v3.0.0 while all other documents are v3.5.0
   - **Resolution**: Updated matrix to v3.5.0 and incorporated all new features from latest version

2. **Missing User Stories**:
   - **Issue**: Matrix lacked US-017 through US-021 present in v3.5.0 documents
   - **Resolution**: Added all missing user stories with complete requirement mappings

3. **Module Naming Discrepancy**:
   - **Issue**: M005 was listed as "Document Parser" but Architecture shows it as "Tracking Matrix"
   - **Resolution**: Corrected to "Tracking Matrix" per Architecture Blueprint v3.5.0

4. **Quality Gate Threshold**:
   - **Issue**: Matrix showed 85% as minimum, v3.5.0 docs specify "exactly 85%"
   - **Resolution**: Updated to specify "exactly 85%" throughout

5. **Memory Mode Terminology**:
   - **Issue**: Inconsistent memory mode naming across documents
   - **Resolution**: Standardized to Baseline/Standard/Enhanced/Performance per v3.5.0

6. **Cost Management Gap**:
   - **Issue**: No cost management requirements despite extensive coverage in PRD/SRS
   - **Resolution**: Added FR-025/FR-026 for comprehensive cost management

7. **RBAC Missing**:
   - **Issue**: SRS references role-based access control but not in matrix
   - **Resolution**: Added SEC-005 for RBAC enforcement

8. **Stakeholder Communication**:
   - **Issue**: US-013 emphasizes stakeholder communication but OR-003 didn't reflect this
   - **Resolution**: Expanded OR-003 to include "stakeholder-ready exports"

9. **Implementation Phases**:
   - **Issue**: No phase information in original matrix
   - **Resolution**: Added implementation phases aligned with PRD roadmap (Phases 1-3)
</inconsistencies_and_resolutions>

<alignment_explanation>

## Alignment with ChatGPT-5 Analysis

The updated Traceability Matrix v3.5.0 directly addresses all recommendations from the ChatGPT-5 analysis:

1. **Strengthened Module Traceability**: M005 and M009 now have explicit requirement linkages and test case mappings, eliminating the weak connections identified in the analysis.

2. **RBAC Addition**: Added SEC-005 for role-based access control as specifically recommended, ensuring security requirements are comprehensive.

3. **Redundancy Elimination**: Consolidated overlapping Git-related requirements (SA-004/INT-004) into clearer, non-redundant specifications.

4. **Requirements Expansion**: OR-003 and OR-004 now explicitly align with PRD intent, including stakeholder communication and adaptive learning aspects.

5. **Metrics Alignment**: Time savings metric now directly links to SRS performance requirements (NFR-001, NFR-002), closing the gap identified in the analysis.

6. **Acceptance Criteria Clarity**: DC-003 (MIAIR methodology) now has clear validation criteria through entropy reduction targets and quality scoring.

7. **Change Impact Documentation**: Added a new section identifying high-risk components and their cascade effects, particularly for US-007 (Enhancement Pipeline) and US-017 (Privacy Architecture).

8. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The matrix now covers all 21 user stories, 29 functional requirements, and includes new compliance features (SBOM, PII, DSR) from v3.5.0.

This updated matrix provides complete bidirectional traceability between requirements, user stories, architecture components, and test cases, ensuring that any change in one area can be immediately traced to all affected areas. The alignment with v3.5.0 documentation suite ensures consistency across all project artifacts.
