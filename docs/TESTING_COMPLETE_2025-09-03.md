3. **UI Component Separation** (RESOLVED)
   - **Issue**: VS Code components breaking browser application
   - **Solution**: Properly separated VS Code and browser components
   - **File Modified**: `src/modules/M011-UIComponents/components/index.ts`

4. **Quality Analyzer API Reliability** (RESOLVED) - Phase 5
   - **Issue**: Persistent CORS and fetch errors preventing quality analysis
   - **Impact**: Quality Analyzer feature completely non-functional
   - **Solution**: Created production-grade API server with enterprise reliability
   - **Files Created**: 
     - `production_api_server.py` (869 lines, enterprise-grade reliability)
     - `PRODUCTION_API_RELIABILITY_SOLUTION.md` (comprehensive documentation)
   - **Files Modified**: 
     - `src/components/QualityAnalyzer.tsx` (updated CORS configuration)
   - **Features Added**:
     - Circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance
     - Rate limiting with token bucket algorithm
     - Comprehensive CORS handling with preflight caching
     - Request/response integrity validation (SHA256)
     - Health monitoring and metrics collection
     - Real AI integration (M005 Quality Engine + M008 LLM Adapter)
