## Security Enhancements Implemented

### 1. SecurityManager Class (330 lines)

### 4. Context Extraction Security (70+ lines)
- **Path Validation**: All extracted file paths validated
- **AST Security**: Python AST nodes validated against dangerous operations
- **File Size Limits**: 1MB file size limit to prevent DOS
- **File Count Limits**: Maximum 1000 files per extraction

### 5. Performance Monitor Security (30+ lines)
- **Metadata Sanitization**: All logged metadata sanitized
- **Timing Jitter**: Random timing variance to prevent timing attacks
- **Metric Rotation**: Automatic rotation to prevent memory exhaustion

### 6. Resource DOS Protection
- **Memory Quotas**: 512MB-4096MB based on mode
- **CPU Throttling**: 25%-100% CPU limits
- **Concurrent Limits**: 10-1000 concurrent operations
- **Real-time Monitoring**: psutil-based resource tracking
