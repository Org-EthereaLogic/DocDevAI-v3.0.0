# GitHub Actions Workflow Modification Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the proper procedures for modifying GitHub Actions workflows in the DevDocAI project. Following these procedures helps prevent workflow failures and maintains CI/CD pipeline integrity.

## Pre-Modification Checklist

Before modifying any workflow file:

- [ ] Understand the current workflow purpose and structure
- [ ] Review recent workflow run history for context
- [ ] Ensure you have proper permissions
- [ ] Have YAML validation tools installed locally
- [ ] Create a feature branch for changes

## Required Tools

### Local Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# Install yamllint for YAML validation (REQUIRED)
pip install yamllint

# Install actionlint for GitHub Actions validation (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)
# macOS
brew install actionlint

# Linux/WSL
go install github.com/rhysd/actionlint/cmd/actionlint@latest

# Alternative: Download pre-built binary
curl -L https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint/releases/latest/download/actionlint_1.6.26_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar xz
sudo mv actionlint /usr/local/bin/

# Verify installation
yamllint --version
actionlint --version
```

### Development Container Setup

If using the DevDocAI development container, install tools inside the container:

```bash
# Enter the container
./docker-dev.sh shell

# Install validation tools
pip install yamllint
go install github.com/rhysd/actionlint/cmd/actionlint@latest

# Test the tools
yamllint .github/workflows/security-audit.yml
actionlint .github/workflows/security-audit.yml
```

## Workflow Modification Process

### 1. Create Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b fix/workflow-name-description
```

### 2. Make Changes

Edit the workflow file in `.github/workflows/`:

```yaml
# Example: Adding permissions block
jobs:
  deploy:
    permissions:
      contents: read
      deployments: write
```

### 3. Validate Locally

#### YAML Syntax Validation

```bash
# Validate YAML syntax
yamllint .github/workflows/your-workflow.yml

# Or use Python for basic validation
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/your-workflow.yml'))"
```

#### GitHub Actions Specific Validation

```bash
# If actionlint is installed
actionlint .github/workflows/your-workflow.yml

# Or use GitHub's online validator:
# https://rhysd.github.io/actionlint/
```

### 4. Test with Act (Optional)

Test workflows locally using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act):

```bash
# Install act
brew install act  # macOS
# or download from https://github.com/nektos/act

# Test workflow locally
act -W .github/workflows/your-workflow.yml
```

### 5. Commit Changes

```bash
# Stage changes
git add .github/workflows/your-workflow.yml

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "fix(ci): correct permissions in deploy workflow

- Added missing permissions block to deploy-development job
- Fixed YAML syntax error in permissions declaration
- Validated with yamllint and actionlint"
```

### 6. Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push branch
git push origin fix/workflow-name-description

# Create PR via GitHub CLI
gh pr create --title "Fix workflow permissions" \
  --body "Fixes YAML syntax errors in deploy.yml workflow"
```

### 7. Monitor Workflow Runs

After merging:

1. Check Actions tab for workflow execution
2. Monitor for any failures
3. Review logs if issues occur

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Workflow-Level Permissions (Most Common Error)

**Problem**: Workflow fails immediately with "permissions" field error

```yaml
# ‚ùå CRITICAL ERROR - Causes 100% workflow failures
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write

name: My Workflow
```

```yaml
# ‚úÖ Correct - Permissions at job level
name: My Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  my-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      security-events: write
```

**Root Cause**: GitHub Actions does not support workflow-level permissions in this format. The `permissions` block must be placed under individual jobs, not at the workflow level.

### Missing Permissions Block

**Problem**: Job fails with permission denied error

```yaml
# ‚ùå Incorrect
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    contents: read  # Missing 'permissions:' key
```

```yaml
# ‚úÖ Correct
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      deployments: write
```

### Invalid YAML Indentation

**Problem**: Workflow fails to parse

```yaml
# ‚ùå Incorrect - inconsistent indentation
jobs:
  test:
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
     - uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

```yaml
# ‚úÖ Correct - consistent 2-space indentation
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

### Undefined Secrets

**Problem**: Workflow fails with "secret not found"

```yaml
# Ensure secrets are defined in repository settings
# Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions

env:
  API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}  # Must exist in secrets
```

## Validation Checklist

Before committing workflow changes:

- [ ] YAML syntax validated with `yamllint`
- [ ] GitHub Actions syntax validated with `actionlint` or online validator
- [ ] Permissions blocks properly formatted
- [ ] All required secrets documented
- [ ] Environment variables defined
- [ ] Job dependencies correctly specified
- [ ] Conditional logic tested
- [ ] Branch protection rules considered

## Emergency Fixes

If a workflow is blocking critical operations:

1. **Revert via GitHub UI**:
   - Go to the problematic commit
   - Click "Revert"
   - Create revert PR
   - Merge immediately

2. **Quick Fix via CLI**:

```bash
# Revert last commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or disable workflow temporarily
mv .github/workflows/problem.yml .github/workflows/problem.yml.disabled
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: temporarily disable failing workflow"
git push
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always validate locally** before pushing
2. **Use feature branches** for workflow changes
3. **Test incrementally** - make small changes
4. **Document changes** in commit messages
5. **Monitor after deployment** - check workflow runs
6. **Keep workflows simple** - complexity increases failure risk
7. **Version control secrets** documentation (not values!)
8. **Regular audits** - review and update workflows quarterly

## Automated Validation

The project includes comprehensive pre-commit hooks that automatically validate YAML files and prevent the most common workflow failures:

### Pre-Commit Hook Features

```bash
# Hook automatically runs on commit if YAML files are changed
git commit -m "fix: update workflow"
# üìù Validating YAML files...
# üîß Validating GitHub Actions workflows...
# ‚úÖ YAML syntax validation passed
# ‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflow validation passed
```

**What Gets Checked:**

1. **YAML Syntax**: Basic YAML structure and formatting via `yamllint`
2. **GitHub Actions Syntax**: Comprehensive workflow validation via `actionlint`
3. **Common Field Ordering**: Detects workflow-level permissions blocks (primary failure cause)
4. **Workflow Structure**: Validates job definitions, steps, and dependencies
5. **Secret References**: Checks for undefined secrets and variables

### Manual Validation Commands

```bash
# Run all pre-commit checks
npm run pre-commit

# YAML-only validation
yamllint .github/workflows/*.yml

# GitHub Actions specific validation (if actionlint installed)
actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml

# Basic validation without actionlint
python3 -c "import yaml; [yaml.safe_load(open(f)) for f in ['.github/workflows/ci.yml']]"
```

### Prevention Measures Implemented

1. **Enhanced Pre-Commit Hooks**: Automatically catch permissions placement errors
2. **Actionlint Integration**: Comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow validation
3. **Field Ordering Detection**: Specific checks for workflow-level permissions
4. **Clear Error Messages**: Detailed guidance on how to fix common issues
5. **Fallback Validation**: Basic checks even without actionlint installed
