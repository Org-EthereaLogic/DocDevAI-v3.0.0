## Migration Guide

### Upgrading from Pass 1

1. **Install new dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Update configuration**:

   ```python
   settings = EnhancementSettings(
       operation_mode=OperationMode.PERFORMANCE,  # Enable optimizations
       cache_enabled=True,
       parallel_execution=True,
       batch_size=20  # Optimal for most workloads
   )
   ```

3. **Use batch processing for best performance**:

   ```python
   # Instead of:
   for doc in documents:
       result = await pipeline.enhance_document(doc)
   
   # Use:
   results = await pipeline.enhance_batch(documents)
   ```

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **GPU Acceleration**: For semantic similarity and ML models
2. **Distributed Processing**: Multi-node scaling with Redis/RabbitMQ
3. **Advanced Caching**: Predictive pre-fetching based on usage patterns
