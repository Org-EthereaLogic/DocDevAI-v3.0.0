# DevDocAI Frontend Prototype - ARCHIVED

**Archive Date**: September 12, 2025
**Status**: PROTOTYPE - NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE

## What This Contains

This is the **prototype frontend** that was built before proper design specifications were available. It contains:

- ‚úÖ **Working Vue 3 + Vite + Tailwind CSS setup**
- ‚úÖ **Basic FastAPI integration** (form submission working)
- ‚úÖ **Document generation flow** (validated with real AI)
- ‚ùå **Not based on v3.6.0 design specifications**
- ‚ùå **Basic UI that doesn't match proper mockups**
- ‚ùå **Missing comprehensive features from design docs**

## Why Archived

- Frontend was built as a **quick prototype** without proper design foundation
- **v3.6.0 Design Specifications** are now available in `/docs/01-specifications/`
- Need **clean slate rebuild** following actual mockups and wireframes
- This prototype was successful in proving **Vue 3 + FastAPI integration works**

## Useful Components for Reference

- `/src/components/DocumentGeneration.vue` - Working AI integration
- `/src/components/ReadmeForm.vue` - Form submission patterns
- `/tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration
- `/vite.config.js` - Vite build configuration
- `/package.json` - Dependencies that work

## Technology Stack (Proven Working)

- **Frontend**: Vue 3.4.29 + Vite 5.3.1 + Tailwind CSS 3.4.4
- **Backend Integration**: FastAPI working at http://localhost:8000
- **Real AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 document generation confirmed (~43 seconds)

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Archived** - This prototype preserved for reference
2. üöÄ **Fresh Build** - New frontend based on v3.6.0 design specifications
3. üéØ **Proper Implementation** - Follow comprehensive mockups and wireframes
4. üîó **Integration** - Use proven Vue 3 + FastAPI patterns from this prototype
