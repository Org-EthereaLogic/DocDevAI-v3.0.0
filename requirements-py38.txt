# Python 3.8 specific dependency constraints
# These versions are known to work well with Python 3.8

# Core - use compatible versions
numpy<1.25.0  # 1.25+ drops Python 3.8 support
scipy<1.11.0  # 1.11+ may have issues with Python 3.8

# AI/ML - these should work but pin if issues arise
openai>=1.0.0
anthropic>=0.25.0
google-generativeai>=0.5.0
