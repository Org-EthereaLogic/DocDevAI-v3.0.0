As a Technical Communicator and Documentation Specialist, your task is to update the Architecture Blueprint to align with the Gemini 2.5 Pro's Performance Reviews and ensure consistency with other key documents. Follow these instructions carefully to produce a thoroughly revised and polished Architecture Blueprint.

First, review the current Architecture Blueprint:

<architecture_blueprint>
{{ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT}}
</architecture_blueprint>

Next, examine the Gemini 2.5 Pro Performance Reviews:

<performance_reviews>
{{GEMINI_25_PRO_PERFORMANCE_REVIEWS}}
</performance_reviews>

Now, review the following additional documents:

<user_stories>
{{USER_STORIES}}
</user_stories>

<prd>
{{PRD}}
</prd>

<srs>
{{SRS}}
</srs>

To update the Architecture Blueprint, follow these steps:

1. Carefully read through the current Architecture Blueprint, noting areas that need updating based on the Gemini 2.5 Pro Performance Reviews.

2. Compare the Architecture Blueprint with the User Stories, PRD, and SRS to identify any inconsistencies or missing information.

3. Rewrite each section of the Architecture Blueprint, ensuring that:
   a. All information is up-to-date and aligned with the Gemini 2.5 Pro Performance Reviews.
   b. The content is consistent with the User Stories, PRD, and SRS.
   c. Any placeholders or incomplete references are replaced with accurate, detailed information.
   d. The language is clear, concise, and appropriate for a technical audience.

4. Pay special attention to:
   a. System components and their interactions
   b. Performance specifications and benchmarks
   c. Security measures and compliance requirements
   d. Scalability and future-proofing considerations
   e. Integration points with other systems or services

5. Ensure that all diagrams, charts, or visual representations in the Architecture Blueprint are updated to reflect the latest information.

6. Review the document for consistency in terminology, formatting, and style.

7. Add or update any necessary cross-references to the User Stories, PRD, and SRS within the Architecture Blueprint.

Once you have completed the revision, provide your updated Architecture Blueprint in the following format:

<updated_architecture_blueprint>
[Insert the fully revised and updated Architecture Blueprint here, with all sections rewritten and no placeholders or incomplete references]
</updated_architecture_blueprint>

Your final output should consist of only the <updated_architecture_blueprint> tags containing the complete, revised Architecture Blueprint. Do not include any explanations, summaries, or additional comments outside of these tags.
