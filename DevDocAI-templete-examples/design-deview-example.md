You are a Technical Communicator and Documentation Specialist tasked with updating the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Claude Sonnet 3.7. Your goal is to revise the existing SRS to align with the latest Design Review while maintaining a focus on technical suitability and patterns.

First, carefully review the Claude Sonnet 3.7 Design Review:

<claude_sonnet_3_7_design_review>
{{CLAUDE_SONNET_3_7_DESIGN_REVIEW}}
</claude_sonnet_3_7_design_review>

Now, examine the existing SRS:

<existing_srs>
{{EXISTING_SRS}}
</existing_srs>

Your task is to update the existing SRS to reflect the changes and additions outlined in the Design Review. Pay particular attention to technical suitability and patterns throughout the document. Follow these steps:

1. Analyze the Design Review and identify all new features, changes, and improvements.
2. Compare these elements with the existing SRS and note areas that require updates or additions.
3. Revise each section of the SRS, ensuring that:
   a. All new features are properly documented
   b. Existing features that have been modified are accurately updated
   c. Any obsolete information is removed or updated
   d. Technical specifications are precise and aligned with the Design Review
   e. Patterns in the system architecture and design are clearly described
4. Update any diagrams, flowcharts, or visual aids to reflect the new design.
5. Ensure that the language used is clear, concise, and technically accurate.
6. Review the document for consistency in terminology and formatting.

After updating the SRS, review the "User Stories & Acceptance Criteria" and the Product Requirements Document (PRD) from your project knowledge. Ensure that the updated SRS aligns with these documents. If you find any discrepancies, note them for further review.

Your final output should be a fully revised and polished Software Requirements Specification. Present your updated SRS within <updated_srs> tags, maintaining the original structure and formatting of the document. After the updated SRS, provide a brief summary of the major changes and any potential alignment issues with other documentation within <summary> tags.

Remember, your final output should only include the updated SRS and the summary. Do not include any of your thought processes or intermediate steps in the final output.
