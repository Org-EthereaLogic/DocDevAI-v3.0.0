As a Technical Communicator and Documentation Specialist, your task is to update the Architecture Blueprint for Gemini 2.5 Pro, ensuring it aligns with recent Security Reviews and other key documents. Follow these instructions carefully to produce a thoroughly revised and polished document.

First, review the current Architecture Blueprint:

<architecture_blueprint>
{{ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT}}
</architecture_blueprint>

Next, familiarize yourself with the User Stories, Product Requirements Document (PRD), and Software Requirements Specification (SRS):

<user_stories>
{{USER_STORIES}}
</user_stories>

<prd>
{{PRD}}
</prd>

<srs>
{{SRS}}
</srs>

Now, examine the Security Reviews:

<security_reviews>
{{SECURITY_REVIEWS}}
</security_reviews>

To update the Architecture Blueprint:

1. Carefully review each section of the Architecture Blueprint.
2. Incorporate relevant security measures and considerations from the Security Reviews into appropriate sections.
3. Ensure that the architectural design aligns with the user stories, requirements, and specifications outlined in the User Stories, PRD, and SRS.
4. Rewrite and refine each section of the Architecture Blueprint, ensuring clarity, completeness, and technical accuracy.
5. Remove any placeholders or incomplete references.
6. Add new sections or subsections as necessary to address all security and functional requirements.
7. Update diagrams, flowcharts, or other visual elements to reflect the revised architecture.
8. Verify that all components, interfaces, and data flows are accurately described and aligned with the latest security and functional requirements.

Guidelines for ensuring alignment:

1. Cross-reference each major component or feature in the Architecture Blueprint with the corresponding items in the User Stories, PRD, and SRS.
2. Ensure that all security measures mentioned in the Security Reviews are appropriately addressed in the architectural design.
3. Verify that the technical solutions proposed in the Architecture Blueprint satisfy the functional and non-functional requirements specified in the PRD and SRS.
4. Check that the architecture supports the user workflows described in the User Stories.

Your final output should be a completely revised Architecture Blueprint. Present your updated document within <updated_architecture_blueprint> tags. Ensure that:

1. All sections are fully rewritten and polished.
2. There are no placeholders or incomplete references.
3. The document is well-structured, with clear headings and subheadings.
4. Technical language is precise and consistent throughout.
5. Security considerations are integrated seamlessly into the architectural design.
6. The document aligns fully with the User Stories, PRD, and SRS.

After presenting the updated Architecture Blueprint, provide a brief summary of the major changes and improvements made, highlighting how the document now better aligns with the Security Reviews and other key documents. Present this summary within <revision_summary> tags.

Remember, your output should consist only of the updated Architecture Blueprint and the revision summary, enclosed in their respective tags. Do not include any other text or explanations outside of these tags.
