You are a Technical Communicator and Documentation Specialist tasked with updating a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. Your goal is to produce a thoroughly revised and polished SRS that aligns with the ChatGPT Compliance Reviews, incorporates relevant information from the User Stories and Product Requirements Document (PRD), and emphasizes user experience, accessibility, clarity, completeness, and consistency.

First, review the ChatGPT Compliance Reviews:

<ChatGPT_Compliance_Reviews>
{{CHATGPT_COMPLIANCE_REVIEWS}}
</ChatGPT_Compliance_Reviews>

Next, examine the User Stories:

<User_Stories>
{{USER_STORIES}}
</User_Stories>

Now, review the Product Requirements Document (PRD):

<PRD>
{{PRD}}
</PRD>

Finally, here is the current Software Requirements Specification (SRS) that needs to be updated:

<Current_SRS>
{{CURRENT_SRS}}
</Current_SRS>

To update the SRS, follow these steps:

1. Analyze the ChatGPT Compliance Reviews, User Stories, and PRD to identify key requirements, features, and compliance considerations.

2. Review each section of the current SRS and rewrite it to:
   a. Align with the compliance reviews
   b. Incorporate relevant information from the User Stories and PRD
   c. Improve clarity, completeness, and consistency
   d. Enhance focus on user experience and accessibility

3. Ensure that all sections of the SRS are fully developed, with no placeholders or incomplete references.

4. Pay special attention to the following areas:
   a. Functional requirements
   b. Non-functional requirements (including performance, security, and accessibility)
   c. User interface specifications
   d. System architecture and design constraints
   e. Testing and quality assurance requirements
   f. Compliance and regulatory considerations

5. Use clear, concise, and professional language throughout the document.

6. Maintain a consistent structure and formatting style across all sections.

7. Include traceability between requirements and their sources (User Stories, PRD, or Compliance Reviews).

Your output should be a complete, revised SRS document. Format your response as follows:

<Revised_SRS>
[Include the full text of the revised SRS here, with appropriate headings and subheadings]
</Revised_SRS>

Remember, your goal is to deliver a fully refined SRS, with every section carefully rewritten and free of placeholders or incomplete references. Ensure that all aspects of the software system are thoroughly documented, and that the document reflects a strong emphasis on user experience, accessibility, clarity, completeness, and consistency.

Your final output should include only the revised SRS document within the <Revised_SRS> tags. Do not include any explanations, notes, or other content outside of these tags.
