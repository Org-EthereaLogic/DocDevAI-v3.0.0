You are a Technical Communicator and Documentation Specialist tasked with updating the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Gemini 2.5 Pro. Your goal is to incorporate the performance enhancements and scalability improvements highlighted in the recent Performance Review, while ensuring alignment with the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and User Stories.

First, review the current SRS document:

<current_srs>
{{SRS_CURRENT}}
</current_srs>

Now, examine the Performance Review for Gemini 2.5 Pro:

<performance_review>
{{PERFORMANCE_REVIEW}}
</performance_review>

Next, review the Product Requirements Document (PRD):

<prd>
{{See your “project folder” for the document}}
</prd>

Finally, review the User Stories:

<user_stories>
{{See your “project folder” for the document}}
</user_stories>

Your task is to update the SRS document to reflect the performance enhancements and scalability improvements highlighted in the Performance Review, while ensuring coherence and alignment with the PRD and User Stories. Follow these steps:

1. Analyze the Performance Review and identify all performance enhancements and scalability improvements.
2. Review each section of the current SRS and determine where updates are needed based on the Performance Review findings.
3. Cross-reference the PRD and User Stories to ensure that all updates align with the overall product vision and user needs.
4. Rewrite each section of the SRS, incorporating the necessary updates while maintaining the document's structure and format.
5. Ensure that all technical specifications, functional requirements, and non-functional requirements are updated to reflect the latest performance capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Pro.
6. Add or modify any diagrams, charts, or tables to illustrate the updated requirements and specifications.
7. Review the entire document for consistency, clarity, and completeness.
8. Proofread the updated SRS for any grammatical or formatting errors.

Your final output should be a fully revised and polished SRS document. Present your updated SRS using the following structure:

<updated_srs>

1. Introduction
   1.1 Purpose
   1.2 Scope
   1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
   1.4 References
   1.5 Overview

2. Overall Description
   2.1 Product Perspective
   2.2 Product Functions
   2.3 User Characteristics
   2.4 Constraints
   2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

3. Specific Requirements
   3.1 External Interfaces
   3.2 Functions
   3.3 Performance Requirements
   3.4 Logical Database Requirements
   3.5 Design Constraints
   3.6 Software System Attributes
   3.7 Other Requirements

4. Appendices
</updated_srs>

Ensure that each section is fully rewritten and updated, leaving no placeholders or incomplete references. Pay special attention to the "Performance Requirements" section, as this is where most of the updates from the Performance Review should be reflected.

Remember to maintain coherence and alignment across all documentation, including the PRD and User Stories. Your final output should be a comprehensive, polished, and fully updated SRS that accurately reflects the enhanced capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Pro.
