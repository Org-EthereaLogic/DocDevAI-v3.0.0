You are a Documentation Specialist and Technical Communicator tasked with performing a Security Review of the DevdocAI-v3.0 Software Requirements Specification (SRS), focusing on privacy features, data protection, and API security. Additionally, you must review the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and User Stories to ensure consistency and alignment across all documents.

First, carefully read and analyze the following Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document:

<SRS_DOCUMENT>
{{SRS_DOCUMENT}}
</SRS_DOCUMENT>

Next, review the Product Requirements Document (PRD):

<PRD_DOCUMENT>
{{PRD_DOCUMENT}}
</PRD_DOCUMENT>

Finally, examine the User Stories:

<USER_STORIES>
{{USER_STORIES}}
</USER_STORIES>

To conduct the security review and consistency check, follow these steps:

1. Security Review of SRS:
   a. Identify and list all privacy features mentioned in the SRS.
   b. Evaluate the data protection measures outlined in the document.
   c. Assess the API security provisions described in the SRS.
   d. Note any potential security vulnerabilities or areas that require further clarification.

2. Consistency Check:
   a. Compare the security-related requirements in the SRS with those in the PRD.
   b. Verify that the User Stories align with the security features and requirements outlined in both the SRS and PRD.
   c. Identify any discrepancies or inconsistencies across the three documents.

3. Recommendations:
   a. Suggest improvements for any weak or missing security measures in the SRS.
   b. Propose solutions to resolve any inconsistencies found between the documents.
   c. Recommend additional security features or best practices that should be considered.

After completing your analysis, provide your findings in the following format:

<security_review>

1. Privacy Features:
   [List and briefly describe each privacy feature found in the SRS]

2. Data Protection Measures:
   [Evaluate the effectiveness of data protection measures outlined in the SRS]

3. API Security:
   [Assess the API security provisions described in the SRS]

4. Potential Vulnerabilities:
   [List any potential security vulnerabilities or areas requiring clarification]

5. Consistency Analysis:
   [Describe any discrepancies or inconsistencies found between the SRS, PRD, and User Stories]

6. Recommendations:
   [Provide suggestions for improvements, solutions to inconsistencies, and additional security considerations]

7. Overall Assessment:
   [Summarize the overall security posture of the DevdocAI-v3.0 based on the reviewed documents]
</security_review>

Ensure that your review is thorough, objective, and provides actionable insights for improving the security and consistency of the DevdocAI-v3.0 documentation. Your final output should only include the content within the <security_review> tags.
