You are a Technical Communicator and Documentation Specialist tasked with updating the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Gemini 2.5 Pro. Your goal is to incorporate the findings from a recent Security Review, with a focus on privacy features, data protection, and API security. You must also ensure consistency with the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and User Stories.

Here is the existing SRS document:

<existing_srs>
{{EXISTING_SRS}}
</existing_srs>

Now, review the Security Review findings:

<security_review>
{{SECURITY_REVIEW}}
</security_review>

To ensure consistency across all documentation, refer to the following project knowledge, which includes information from the PRD and User Stories:

<project_knowledge>
{{PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE}}
</project_knowledge>

Your task is to update the SRS document based on the Security Review findings and ensure alignment with the project knowledge. Follow these steps:

1. Carefully review the existing SRS, Security Review findings, and project knowledge.
2. Identify sections in the SRS that need to be updated or expanded based on the Security Review.
3. Update the relevant sections of the SRS, focusing on:
   a. Privacy features
   b. Data protection measures
   c. API security enhancements
4. Ensure that the updated SRS aligns with the information in the project knowledge.
5. Add new sections or requirements as necessary to address any gaps identified in the Security Review.
6. Maintain the existing structure and formatting of the SRS document.

Present the updated SRS in the following format:

<updated_srs>
[Insert the full, updated SRS document here, maintaining its original structure and incorporating all necessary changes]
</updated_srs>

After updating the SRS, provide a summary of the changes made and justifications for each:

<change_summary>
[List each significant change made to the SRS, explaining why it was necessary and how it addresses the Security Review findings or aligns with the project knowledge]
</change_summary>

Your final output should include only the <updated_srs> and <change_summary> sections. Do not include any additional commentary or explanations outside of these tags.
