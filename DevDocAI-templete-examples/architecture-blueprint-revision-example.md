As a Technical Communicator and Documentation Specialist, your task is to update the DevDocAI - Architecture Blueprint to align with recent ChatGPT-5 Usability Reviews and other relevant documents. Your goal is to produce a thoroughly revised and polished document that emphasizes user experience, accessibility, clarity, completeness, and consistency.

You will be working with the following input documents:

<chatgpt5_usability_reviews>
{{CHATGPT5_USABILITY_REVIEWS}}
</chatgpt5_usability_reviews>

<user_stories>
{{USER_STORIES}}
</user_stories>

<prd>
{{PRD}}
</prd>

<srs>
{{SRS}}
</srs>

<current_architecture_blueprint>
{{CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT}}
</current_architecture_blueprint>

Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Carefully review all input documents, paying special attention to the ChatGPT-5 Usability Reviews and how they relate to the current Architecture Blueprint.

2. Analyze the User Stories, PRD, and SRS to ensure that all requirements and user needs are accurately reflected in the updated Architecture Blueprint.

3. Revise each section of the Architecture Blueprint, addressing the following aspects:
   a. User experience improvements
   b. Accessibility enhancements
   c. Clarity of information
   d. Completeness of content
   e. Consistency across sections

4. Rewrite and refine every section of the Architecture Blueprint, ensuring that there are no placeholders or incomplete references.

5. Incorporate new information from the ChatGPT-5 Usability Reviews, User Stories, PRD, and SRS as appropriate.

6. Ensure that the document structure is logical and easy to navigate.

7. Use clear, concise, and professional language throughout the document.

8. Include relevant diagrams, flowcharts, or other visual aids to enhance understanding of the architecture.

9. Update any version numbers, dates, or other metadata as necessary.

10. Proofread the entire document for grammar, spelling, and formatting consistency.

Your output should be a complete, polished Architecture Blueprint. Use the following guidelines for writing style and tone:

- Use active voice and present tense where appropriate
- Write in a clear, concise, and professional manner
- Avoid jargon or overly technical language unless necessary
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity when appropriate
- Maintain a consistent tone throughout the document

After completing the revision, conduct a final review to ensure that:

- All sections are complete and free of placeholders
- The document aligns with the ChatGPT-5 Usability Reviews
- User Stories, PRD, and SRS requirements are accurately reflected
- The overall structure is logical and easy to follow
- All diagrams and visual aids are up-to-date and relevant

Present your final output within <revised_architecture_blueprint> tags. Your output should consist only of the fully revised and polished Architecture Blueprint, without any additional commentary or explanations outside of the document itself.
