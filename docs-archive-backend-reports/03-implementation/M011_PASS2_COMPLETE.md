## Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Streaming Architecture
```python
class StreamingProcessor:
    async def process_document_stream(
        self,
        document_path: Path,
        processor: Callable[[str], Any],
    ) -> AsyncIterator[Any]:
        # Processes in chunks without loading entire file
```

### 2. Intelligent Caching
```python
class BatchCache:
    - LRU eviction when size limit reached
    - TTL expiration for stale entries
    - O(1) get/put operations
    - Thread-safe with minimal lock contention
```

### 3. Memory-Aware Processing
```python
class MemoryManager:
    - Dynamic batch size adjustment
    - Concurrency throttling under pressure
    - Automatic GC triggers at thresholds
    - Resource recommendations
```

### 4. Queue Optimization
```python
class OptimizedQueue:
    - Priority queue with heap operations
    - Prefetch buffer for reduced latency
    - Batch enqueue/dequeue operations
    - Minimal lock contention
```
