## 🎯 **Project Status: Clean Slate Development**

**Current Branch**: `development/v3.1.0-clean`  
**Implementation Status**: 0% - Starting fresh  
**Design Status**: Complete and approved  

### ⚠️ **Important**: This is a Development Branch

This branch represents a **complete restart** of DevDocAI v3.0.0 following strict design compliance. Previous attempts had architectural drift that caused instability.

**For the stable version, see**: `main` branch  
**For archived experiments, see**: `archive/template-quality-experiments` branch

---

## 📋 **Single Source of Truth: Design Documents**

**All development MUST follow the comprehensive design specifications:**

### **Core Specifications**
- 📘 **[Product Requirements Document (PRD)](docs/01-specifications/requirements/DESIGN-devdocai-prd.md)** - What we're building
- 📗 **[Software Requirements Specification (SRS)](docs/01-specifications/requirements/DESIGN-devdocai-srs.md)** - Detailed requirements  
- 📙 **[Software Design Document (SDD)](docs/01-specifications/architecture/DESIGN-devdocsai-sdd.md)** - How we're building it
- 📕 **[Architecture Document](docs/01-specifications/architecture/DESIGN-devdocsai-architecture.md)** - System architecture

### **Implementation Guidance**  
- 🔧 **[Build Instructions](docs/03-guides/deployment/DESIGN-devdocai-build-instructions.md)** - How to build
- 👥 **[User Stories](docs/01-specifications/requirements/DESIGN-devdocsai-user-stories.md)** - User requirements
- 🧪 **[Test Plan](docs/05-quality/testing/DESIGN-devdocai-test-plan.md)** - Quality assurance

## 🏗️ **What We're Building (Per Design Docs)**

DevDocAI is an **AI-powered documentation assistant** for solo developers with three main interfaces:

### **Core Product Vision**
- 📝 **AI-powered document generation** from code
- 🤖 **Intelligent quality analysis** with improvement suggestions  
- 🔒 **100% private** - everything runs locally
- ⚡ **High performance** - 248,000 documents per minute
- 🎨 **Professional templates** - 35+ templates for every need

### **Three Main Interfaces**
1. **🖥️ CLI Interface**: `devdocai generate README.md`
2. **🌐 Web Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000  
3. **🔌 VS Code Extension**: Integrated development experience

## 🚀 **Development Approach**

### **Strict Design Compliance**
- ✅ **Follow design docs exactly** - no architectural drift
- ✅ **Build in phases** - CLI → Web → VS Code Extension
- ✅ **Keep it simple** - avoid over-engineering 
- ✅ **Test continuously** - maintain quality gates

### **Development Phases**
1. **Phase 1**: Basic CLI Interface (`devdocai generate`)
2. **Phase 2**: Simple Web Dashboard (localhost:3000)
3. **Phase 3**: Direct AI Integration (OpenAI/Anthropic)
4. **Phase 4**: Template System (35+ templates)
5. **Phase 5**: VS Code Extension
6. **Phase 6**: Performance Optimization

---

## 🛡️ **Quality Assurance**

### **Design Compliance Checks**
- Every feature must map to design documents
- No implementation without specification
- Regular design document review sessions

### **Testing Strategy**  
- Test-driven development
- Continuous integration
- Performance benchmarking
- User acceptance testing

---

## 🤝 **Contributing**

### **For Developers**
1. **Read the design docs first**: Start with [PRD](docs/01-specifications/requirements/DESIGN-devdocai-prd.md)
2. **Follow CLAUDE.md**: AI development guidelines
3. **Use AGENTS.md**: Agent workflow specifications
4. **Maintain compliance**: Every PR must reference design docs

### **For Reviewers**
- Verify design document compliance
- Check implementation matches specifications
- Ensure no architectural drift
