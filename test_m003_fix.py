    # Software Architecture Document
    
    ## Overview
    This document provides comprehensive architectural guidelines for modern software development.
    
    ## Core Components
    The system consists of several interconnected modules that work together to provide
    a scalable and maintainable solution for document processing and analysis.
    
    ### Data Processing Layer
    - Input validation and sanitization
    - Data transformation and normalization
    - Error handling and recovery mechanisms
    
    ### Business Logic Layer
    - Core business rules implementation
    - Workflow orchestration
    - Decision making algorithms
    
    ### Presentation Layer
    - User interface components
    - API endpoints
    - Response formatting
    
    ## Performance Considerations
    The architecture is designed to handle high throughput scenarios with:
    - Asynchronous processing capabilities
    - Caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
    - Load balancing across multiple instances
    - Database query optimization
    
    ## Security Features
    - Authentication and authorization
    - Data encryption at rest and in transit
    - Input validation and output sanitization
    - Audit logging and monitoring
