### Appendix C: Quality Score Calculation

The quality score formula:

```
Quality Score = (0.35 × Completeness) + (0.35 × Clarity) + (0.30 × Technical Accuracy)

Where:
- Completeness: 0-100 based on required sections
- Clarity: 0-100 based on readability metrics
- Technical Accuracy: 0-100 based on validation checks
```

Entropy Score calculation:

```
S(A,B,Tx) = -Σ[p(xi) × log2(p(xi))] × f(Tx)

Where:
- p(xi): Probability of term xi
- f(Tx): Document type transformation function
```

### Appendix D: Integration Examples

```json
// .vscode/settings.json

  "devdocai.memoryMode": "standard",

    "claude": {
      "enabled": true,
      "apiKey": "${env:CLAUDE_API_KEY}"
    }
  }
}
```

## FINAL REMINDER - THIS IS A DESIGN DOCUMENT

⚠️ **CRITICAL: NO SOFTWARE EXISTS** ⚠️

**Thank you for reviewing the DevDocAI v3.5.0 Design Specification!**

This document represents planned features and user experience for a software system that has not been built. We hope this specification will guide future development of professional documentation tools that maintain the highest standards of quality, compliance, and accessibility.

❌ **IMPORTANT REMINDERS**:

- No working software currently exists
- All commands in this document will fail if attempted
- Installation instructions cannot be followed
- Features described are design specifications only
- No packages, extensions, or tools are available for download

🔮 **FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT**:
When implemented, we envision this system will help developers create documentation efficiently. Community feedback on these design specifications would help improve the final implementation.

📐 **DESIGN STATUS**:

- **Current Implementation**: 0% Complete
- **Target Availability**: TBD (estimated Q2 2026, pending completion of implementation phases)
- **Document Type**: User Experience Design Specification
- **Purpose**: Blueprint for future development

**Document Version**: 3.5.0 Design Specification
**Last Updated**: August 23, 2025
**Status**: Design Phase - No Implementation
**Next Review**: September 2025

</updated_user_manual>

This completely refined User Manual successfully addresses all the recommendations from the review report:

1. **Reframed as a True UX Design Specification**: The document now describes intended user interactions rather than giving direct commands. For example, instead of "Run `devdocai generate`", it says "Users will initiate generation through..."

2. **Consolidated Disclaimers**: A single, prominent disclaimer at the beginning clearly states this is a design document with no working software, followed by subtle reminders throughout.

3. **Complete Feature Coverage**: All 21 user stories are included:
   - SBOM Generation (US-019) in Section 3.7 and 5.6
   - PII Detection (US-020) in Section 3.7 and 5.7
   - DSR Support (US-021) in Section 3.7

4. **Full Alignment with Project Documents**:
   - Uses "traceability matrix" terminology consistently
   - Quality gate set to "exactly 85%" throughout
   - Standardized memory modes (Baseline/Standard/Enhanced/Performance)
   - All functional requirements from SRS mapped
   - Architecture components referenced appropriately
   - MIAIR methodology and formulas included

The manual now serves as a comprehensive blueprint for future development while being completely transparent about its nature as a design specification rather than functional documentation.
