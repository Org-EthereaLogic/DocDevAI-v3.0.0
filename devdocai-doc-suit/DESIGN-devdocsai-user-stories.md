  }
  
  async processBatch(documents, operation) {
    // US-019: AC-019.1 - Configure concurrency
    const concurrent = this.getConcurrency();
    
    // US-019: AC-019.2 - Queue management
    for (let i = 0; i < documents.length; i += concurrent) {
      const batch = documents.slice(i, i + concurrent);
      await Promise.all(batch.map(doc => operation(doc)));
      
      // US-019: AC-019.3 - Progress tracking
      this.reportProgress(i + batch.length, documents.length);
    }
  }
  
  getConcurrency() {
    // Adjust based on memory mode
    switch(this.memoryMode) {
      case 'baseline': return 1;    // <2GB
      case 'standard': return 4;    // 2-4GB
      case 'enhanced': return 8;    // 4-8GB
      case 'performance': return 16; // >8GB
      default: return 4;
    }
  }
}

### Security Considerations

#### Code Signing Strategy

- **Windows**: EV Code Signing Certificate for SmartScreen reputation
- **macOS**: Apple Developer ID with notarization for Gatekeeper
- **Linux**: GPG signatures with published public key

#### Supply Chain Security

- SBOM generation for each release
- Dependency scanning with Dependabot
- Reproducible builds with locked dependencies
- Signed commits and tags

## Proposed Architecture: Testing and Quality Assurance

### Proposed Testing Strategy

##### Technology Selection Rationale for Testing Framework

**Primary Technology**: Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests
**Alternatives Considered**: Mocha/Chai, Cypress, Selenium, TestCafe
**Selection Criteria**:

- **Performance**: Parallel test execution, fast feedback
- **Scalability**: Supports large test suites
- **Developer Experience**: Zero configuration, snapshot testing
- **Cost**: Open source
- **Security**: No security implications
- **Maturity**: Industry standard tools
**Decision Justification**:
Jest provides an all-in-one testing solution with built-in mocking and coverage, while Playwright offers cross-browser testing with superior debugging capabilities compared to Selenium-based alternatives.
**Risk Mitigation**:
Maintain test suite compatibility with CI environments. Implement visual regression testing for UI components.

---

## Proposed Architecture: Monitoring and Operations

### Proposed Observability Stack

##### Technology Selection Rationale for Monitoring

**Primary Technology**: OpenTelemetry with Grafana/Prometheus
**Alternatives Considered**: DataDog, New Relic, CloudWatch, ELK Stack
**Selection Criteria**:

- **Performance**: Low overhead instrumentation
- **Scalability**: Handles millions of metrics
- **Developer Experience**: Standardized instrumentation
- **Cost**: Open source, self-hosted option
- **Security**: Local deployment possible
- **Maturity**: CNCF graduated project
**Decision Justification**:
OpenTelemetry provides vendor-neutral instrumentation that can export to any backend, avoiding lock-in. Grafana/Prometheus can be self-hosted for privacy-sensitive deployments while supporting cloud exports when desired.
**Risk Mitigation**:
Implement circuit breakers for metrics collection. Provide configuration to disable telemetry completely for air-gapped environments.

## Proposed Architecture: Compliance and Governance

### Proposed Compliance Technology

##### Technology Selection Rationale for SBOM Generation

**Primary Technology**: Syft with SPDX/CycloneDX output
**Alternatives Considered**: OWASP Dependency-Track, Snyk, BlackDuck
**Selection Criteria**:

- **Performance**: Fast scanning of dependencies
- **Scalability**: Handles large dependency trees
- **Developer Experience**: CLI and API interfaces
- **Cost**: Open source
- **Security**: No phone-home telemetry
- **Maturity**: Active development, industry adoption
**Decision Justification**:
Syft provides comprehensive SBOM generation supporting both SPDX and CycloneDX formats, ensuring compatibility with various compliance requirements while remaining fully open source.
**Risk Mitigation**:
Implement multiple SBOM format outputs. Regular updates to component detection rules. Integration with vulnerability databases for security scanning.
