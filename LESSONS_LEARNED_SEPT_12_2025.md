### **Lesson 7: Implementation vs. Design Documentation**

#### **What We Learned**
- Implementation reports serve different purposes than design specifications
- Both types of documentation have value but for different audiences
- Clear separation improves utility for both types

#### **Document Type Matrix**
| Type | Purpose | Audience | Lifecycle | Location |
|------|---------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Design Specifications | Requirements & Architecture | Implementers | Long-term reference | Primary docs directory |
| Implementation Reports | Development progress & decisions | Stakeholders & future developers | Archive after completion | Archive directory |
| Prototype Documentation | Technology validation & patterns | Future implementers | Reference material | Archive with clear status |

#### **Application**
- **Purpose-Driven Organization**: Organize by document purpose, not chronology
- **Audience Consideration**: Structure access based on primary audience needs
- **Lifecycle Management**: Move documents through appropriate lifecycle stages

### **Lesson 8: Technology Validation vs. Production Implementation**

#### **What We Learned**
- Technology validation (prototyping) and production implementation are different phases
- Prototypes prove feasibility; production implementations deliver user value
- Clear phase separation prevents confusion and supports better decision-making

#### **Phase Distinction**
```
PROTOTYPE PHASE:
- Goal: Prove technology feasibility
- Quality: "Good enough to validate"
- Scope: Core functionality only
- Documentation: Reference patterns

PRODUCTION PHASE:
- Goal: Deliver user value
- Quality: Production-ready with full testing
- Scope: Complete feature set per specifications
- Documentation: Complete specifications
```

#### **Application**
- **Clear Phase Definition**: Explicitly define current development phase
- **Appropriate Quality Standards**: Match quality standards to phase purpose
- **Transition Planning**: Plan clear transition from prototype to production
- **Value Preservation**: Preserve prototype value as reference material
